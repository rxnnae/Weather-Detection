  Weather Detection System
</p></h1>

<h5>An IOT- based hardware system capable of detecteing the weather changes from various sensor readings. Read on for the details!</h5>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The weather monitoring system plays a large utility in varied areas from agricultural growth and development to industrial development. Sensing the weather has been important to man over the centuries. The winds and other weather variables are of equal concern and can have an even greater impact on our modern, high-tech lifestyle. A weather station is that facility on land or sea, which has instruments and devices for observing and measuring atmospheric parameters to provide the information for weather forecasts. Modern weather monitoring systems and networks are designed to make the measurements necessary to track these movements in a cost-effective manner.</p>

  <li>Bread board</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Arduino IDE </li>
  <li>ThingSpeak Cloud</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Data from the sensors may also be sent to a web page that is accessible from any location in the world.</li>
<li>Because there are fewer parts, the smart weather monitoring system's maintenance costs are also quite low.</li>
<li>The Smart Weather Monitoring System's sensors collect and analyze data that is used to accurately predict the weather.</li>
<li>These Sensors Can Easily Detect Any Sudden Change in The Forecast Because Of Their High Speed.</li>
<li>In the case of a smart weather monitoring system, a prior warning of the weather conditions is also possible. Visit a website for an IoT portal to quickly see this prior alert.</li>
<li>When compared to traditional weather monitoring systems, the smart weather monitoring system is quite compact and simple to install.</li>
<li>Smart Weather Monitoring Systems Have Very Low Power Requirements.</li>
<li>The Smart Weather Monitoring System's use of much less expensive sensors makes this project very cost-effective.</li>
